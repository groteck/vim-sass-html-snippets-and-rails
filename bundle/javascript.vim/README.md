Description

> Hi JavaScript and VIM fans,
>
> If you want to use VIM to edit/view the JavaScript files, you should have this one.
> Replace it with the javascript syntax file included with the VIMRUNTIME.
>
> Why it is here:
> Because I found that the originaly one which packed with the VIMRUNTIME didn't
> work very well for the JS files in Mozilla Browser/SeaMonkey/Firefox and Dojo.
> So I decided to some refine on it.
>
> Hope it is also useful for you~~~
>
> Good Luck,
